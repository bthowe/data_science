In some ways it is similar to the dice problem in that the value of the card is unknown and there are periodic updates.

# Likelihood 
* the likelihood says, conditional on that hand, what is the probability of that outcome? Hmmm, this might not be useful.
* If a hand has all three cards, or just one, the likelihood of "yes" is no different. Thus, the likelihood function is binary.
