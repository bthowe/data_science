        <p style="margin: 0; padding-top: .5cm">Greetings Kansas City 3rd Ward!</p>
        <p>â€œFor I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ." (Galatians 1: 12) These are the words of Paul, a powerful disciple of Christ in the New Testament, while he was telling his story of conversion to the Galatians who had only ever heard myths about him before. This dictates clearly the way that we receive our testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ, through the Holy Ghost and revelation.</p>
        <p>Let us all hearken unto the words of our Prophet, President Nelson, and apply his advice given to us on receiving personal revelation in this past General Conference and specifically apply it to our own personal testimonies.</p>
        <p>We promise that as you study the word of God and ponder on what he would like you to do next, that you will receive the guidance necessary to grow your testimonies and become worthy disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>We love you and pray for you!</p>
